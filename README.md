# Credit Card Fraud Detection with PyTorch

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model uses **PyTorch**, one of the most powerful libraries for deep learning, to train a classifier on a dataset of credit card transactions. The goal is to accurately predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## **Project Overview**

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project utilizes a neural network built with **PyTorch** to classify transactions as fraudulent or not based on various features like transaction amount, user information, and more. The dataset used in this project contains real-world credit card transaction data, where only a small fraction of the transactions are fraudulent.
